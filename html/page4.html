            <h3>About Our Programs</h3>
            <p>
                    Eagles Mere Conservancy Programs are open to all members and non-members. All children five and
                    under must be accompanied by an adult. Alternative programs will be planned if it rains. Please be on
                    time! All programs begin at The Cabin unless otherwise stated.
            </p>
            <h3>Cabin Programs</h3>
            <p>
                    Summer is a lively time in Eagles Mere. From late June to early September the Conservancy provides
                    dynamic educational programs. For over twenty-five years our naturalists have interacted with the
                    children and teens of Eagles Mere. Activities such as the Pond Poke, building Gnome Homes and the
                    Bug Olympics, have become a tradition passed on from generation to generation. Adults are included
                    in our cabin programs as well. Astronomy Night is a special family event that we all look forward to.
                    We invite you to visit our cabin site see what other fun activities are in store for the summer.
            </p>
            <h3>Evening Programs</h3>
            <p>
                    We depart from the Outlet Pond at 9:30 AM (for those events where we will drive north on 42 to
                    either 154 or 220, we will meet hikers from Laporte & World’s End State Park at the junction of 154 &
                    220 at ~9:40). Unless otherwise noted, be prepared with water, lunch, sturdy shoes, & proper clothing
                    (such as long pants due to briers & stinging nettles). Families encouraged to participate – children
                    must be accompanied by an adult. On some hikes there may be rough terrain & bushwhacking where
                    there is no blazed trail (so identified in hike description).
            </p>
            <p>
                    Hike lengths and elevation change over 150 ft. are estimated for each hike. Afternoon return time will
                    depend on hike length and/or driving distances.
            </p>

            <h3>Special Programs</h3>
            <p>
                    Eagles Mere is a special place that has a unique ambience and beautiful, yet fragile, surroundings,
                    which the Conservancy is committed to preserving. Issues arise from time to time that could impact
                    our beautiful area such as the Woolly Adelgid attacking our hemlock trees or the need for reforestation.
                    The Eagles Mere Conservancy provides evening venues for information and discussion regarding
                    these issues and others that may emerge.
