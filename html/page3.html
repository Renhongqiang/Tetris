                    The goal of the Forest Stewardship program is to preserve the integrity of the naturally occurring
                    plant life within the lands owned by the Eagles Mere Conservancy. This task has a four-fold approach:
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Monitoring the health of the trees</p>
            <p>Identifying areas in need of supplemental plantings</p>
            <p>Removal of invasive plant species</p>
            <p>Planting of indigenous species to enhance the forest habitat.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="../images/page3/mid.png" style="margin-left: 100px; height: 300px; width: 500px;">
            <p>
                    The forestry program of the Eagles Mere Conservancy is based on a strong commitment to restoring
                    the health and diversity of its two forested tracts. Our 380 acres of protected forest adjoin the Loyalsock
            </p>
            <p>
                    State Forest, with which we share a network of woodland trails to hike and enjoy.
                    One goal is to increase the diversity of the forest by establishing a variety of young trees and
                    food-bearing shrubs. We focus on songbird habitat, which is much improved inside our very successful
                    41-acre deer fence that includes both natural and planted trees and shrubs. Here, a variety of
                    healthy plants are now growing without the excessive browsing by deer that has removed so many
                    wildflowers and shrubs outside our fences.
            </p>
            <p>
                    By monitoring the health and development of the forest, we identify areas that need attention. The
                    removal of invasive plants, where needed, is followed by planting suitable native trees and woodland
                    shrubs. We are making steady progress and we continue to respond to new challenges. Recently,
                    Conservancy members planted 500 evergreen tree seedlings underneath hemlocks that are in decline
                    due to a new insect infestation. This and various other plantings over the past several years are
                    part of the Conservancyâ€™s commitment to the future of Eagles Mere and its forests. In this way, we
                    continue to take steps to protect and enrich the land that has been entrusted to us.
