                <p>As we make our way through sometimes snowy and cold days in places near and far from Eagles
                        Mere, we know that brighter and warmer months are ahead, and that this special community will
                        gather again to welcome spring and summer to the moun- tain. For that we are thankful. And in this
                        edition of the Eagles Mere Conservancy Newsletter, we give special thanks to those who have helped
                        preserve this community over the years. Inside you will and articles remembering both Carter Buller
                        and Bob Coniff, and their unique contributions to the EMC. These memorial pieces are a reminder of
                        how Eagles Mere is about both the place and the people.</p>

                        And there is much more to read about in the following pages. Many of you joined us for music, food
                        and drinks in the Dell last July, and Cece Estey King has new information for us as we get ready for
                        the Second Annual “Friend Raiser” coming back to the Dell site on July 18th. Suzanne Lee and Kevin
                        Gardner provide develop- ment and financial details; and be sure to check out the new schedule of
                        events which our educators and committee folks have been working on throughout the off-season.
