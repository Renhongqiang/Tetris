            <h1>Conservancy Announces College Financial
                    Awards Program</h1>
            <p>
                    The Eagles Mere Conservancy Board of Directors unanimously and enthusiastically approved a program to provide
                    a financial awards program to Sullivan County students who have worked with the Conservancy on our “science/research”
                    projects. A minimum of two years involvement is required. Projects must be approved by the Conservancy
                    Board and undertaken under the guidance of the Conservancy Naturalists, Consulting Forester and or others as appropriate.
                    Candidates will need to apply for the awards with the expectation that one student will be awarded a
                    financial grant per year. The grants are for each year the student attends undergraduate school up to a 4 year maximum.

                    Our Student program is designed to provide hands on, real world ecological experience to add to the traditional
                    classroom learning. Although some physical labor is required to help build things, the students are taught plant,
                    tree and insect identification, how to design a “scientifically” valid project, how to write up research results, and how
                    to make science oriented oral presentations. These skills are extremely valuable if the students go on to study science
                    in college, and they are also very valuable in life’s broader context.

                    The Sullivan County High School is one on the smallest schools in the Commonwealth. And the County, one of the
                    poorest, has limited opportunities for students to be involved in science oriented learning outside the classroom.
                    As an adjunct to the classroom, the teachers and the Administration have enthusiastically supported the efforts of
                    our student program in the first two years. The partnership seems to be beneficial to both organizations.

            <p>
                    In the first year of the program, 2014, Ms Bridget Paonessa initiated under the guidance of Steve Jaquith, a number
                    of studies with regard to the effects of deer on forest diversity. Some of these are ongoing multi-year efforts and the
                    research is continuing. Papers published as a result of this effort are available on the Conservancy web site. In 2015,
                    the second year of the program, Ms. Ashley Faus joined Bridget in completing research efforts on the continuing
                    studies, and Ms. Faus was instrumental in developing the new “DeWeese Interpretive Trail” planned to be open this
                    summer.

                    The Conservancy has set up a separate fund for this program called “Educational Grants”. If you are interested in
                    supporting this program, you can earmark a donation for the Educational Fund, and the money will be specifically
                    used for the Grants. To date we have received a donation to “start” the program, and donations in the names of the
                    donor and in the names of others. Donors to the Educational Grant Fund will be listed in the Newsletter and the
                    funds kept/accounted for separately from operational funds.
            </p>
